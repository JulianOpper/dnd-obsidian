# Conditions
*Source: Player's Handbook, p. 289* 

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [blinded](conditions.md#blinded), are impairments, but a few, such as [invisible](conditions.md#invisible), can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [prone](conditions.md#prone) condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:- [blinded](conditions.md#blinded)  - [charmed](conditions.md#charmed)  - [deafened](conditions.md#deafened)  - [exhaustion](conditions.md#exhaustion)  - [frightened](conditions.md#frightened)  - [grappled](conditions.md#grappled)  - [incapacitated](conditions.md#incapacitated)  - [invisible](conditions.md#invisible)  - [paralyzed](conditions.md#paralyzed)  - [petrified](conditions.md#petrified)  - [poisoned](conditions.md#poisoned)  - [prone](conditions.md#prone)  - [restrained](conditions.md#restrained)  - [stunned](conditions.md#stunned)  - [unconscious](conditions.md#unconscious)
